# Donkey Car Project

This project contains files relating to my work on the Donkey Car project. The Donkey Car is a small scale self-driving car that is built using a Raspberry Pi, a camera, and a small RC car. The car is trained to drive itself using a neural network that is trained on images of the track and the steering and throttle inputs of a human driver. The car is built using the [Donkey Car](http://www.donkeycar.com) platform.

## Environment Setup

The project can be setup in one of the three ways:
- Dev container
- Local python virtual environment
- Conda environment
